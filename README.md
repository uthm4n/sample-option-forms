# sample-option-forms

# Setup
1. `git clone https://github.com:uthm4n/sample-option-forms.git && cd $_`
2. `cd` into the appropriate directory 
3. Run the Shell *or* Python script from the appropriate directory

Most likely obvious but ensure that you replace <MORPHEUS_APPLIANCE_URL>, <MORPHEUS_API_TOKEN>, and any other variables in the scripts with the relevant values from your appliance. 

# Usage
For those running Morpheus **6.2.4 or higher**, use the Python script in the `api` folder (since you'll have access to the api endpoint):
    `python3 ./simple-test-form.py`

**< v6.2.4**, use the shell script in the `shell` folder:
    `chmod +x simple-test-form.sh && ./simple-test-form.sh`
